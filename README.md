# SeisDB-scripts

Some useful scripts for building a seismological database.

- `fdsn_get_availability.py`: Get data availability of seismic stations
- `fdsn_get_waveforms.py`: Download seismic waveforms of events
- `fdsn_get_waveforms_v2.py`: Improved version to download seismic waveforms.
  The major improvment is allowing specify the reference phase for the time window.
